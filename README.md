# ASLGrammarTranslator
ASLGrammarTranslator is an English to American Sign Language grammar translator.

## Features
ASLGrammarTranslator manipulates English sentences to follow ASL grammar rules.

The main purpose of this project is to be used in my next iOS app.

This project is essentially a repackaged version of [Harsh Bhavsar's](https://github.com/harshbhavsar) algorith. More information on this can be found in the [credits](#credits).
